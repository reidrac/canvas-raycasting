Canvas + Raycasting Experiment
==============================

Requires HTML5 canvas and requestAnimationFrame support.

Tested with Firefox 19 and Chromium 23. Chromium seems to be slightly faster in
my tests, but I get around 30 FPS in both browsers.

I did this to try the HTML5 canvas element and to play around with Javascript.
This demo is the result of a couple of hack sessions, so please keep it in mind
when reading the code (as in "there are probably better ways of doing this").
